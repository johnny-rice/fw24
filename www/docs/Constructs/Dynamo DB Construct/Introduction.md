# Introduction

The `DynamoDBConstruct` is a part of the FW24 toolkit, designed to simplify the process of integrating AWS DynamoDB tables into your application. With `DynamoDBConstruct`, you can define a DynamoDB table with its properties. The configuration involves setting up name and props:

name: The name of the DynamoDB table.
props: The properties for the DynamoDB table, such as partitionKey, sortKey, and billingMode.
This construct provides a streamlined way to manage DynamoDB tables, making it easier to work with data in your AWS applications. Whether you're storing user data, application logs, or other types of data, `DynamoDBConstruct` simplifies the task of managing DynamoDB tables in AWS. It's an invaluable tool that not only streamlines data storage but also boosts the overall efficiency and responsiveness of your application.
